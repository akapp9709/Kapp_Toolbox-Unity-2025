# Toolkit 2025

This Project Serves as a container for my boilerplate code to be used in the Unity Engine.
This includes:

- Starting architecture for basic Finite State Machines with multi-level decision architecture.
- A node-based editor for Behavior Trees to create more complex logic systems
- Quality of Life scripts that make Unity Development more streamlined
  - Auto Save.
- A library of Ease functions for value animation.
- A simple to implement Timer with Ticking and Completion Events.

This is not a complete project and will be updated as I find new scripts I want to include.
